# Project: Calculator

## The Odin Project - Foundations

My final project is going to combine everything I’ve learned so far: I’re going to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

As usual with these things, there are elements of this project that are not going to be trivially easy for me, but if I’ve been following the course so far, I definitely have everything I need to finish it.

### End of Project Reflections:

1. I probably spent far too long on UI again. Was the very first thing I focused on. Looks good though lol

2. I kept hitting road blocks with the calculator logic. I have the desire to make the code elegant, without first making it functional, so kept coding myself into corners, that while looking elegent, was not functional, then getting frustrated, and scraping the lot to try another approach. What worked in the end was psuedo-coding everything, and when I was happy, layering in functional code from there.
